// npm run ios:device — build, sign and install onto a connected iPhone.
//
// You need this more often than you would think: a FREE Apple developer signature expires after
// 7 days, and the app then refuses to launch until it is re-signed. This is that, in one command.
//
// Three things here were not obvious and cost real time to work out on the poke-vendor/Sideline
// lineage this is ported from, so they are automated rather than written down as instructions to
// follow by hand:
//
//  1. DEVELOPMENT_TEAM is NOT the number in the signing identity's name. The identity reads
//     "Apple Development: you@example.com (9Z2HDDXR94)" and that parenthetical is the identity's
//     own id — passing it gives `error: No Account for Team "9Z2HDDXR94"`, which reads like a
//     missing Xcode account rather than a wrong argument. The team is the certificate's OU field.
//  2. A free profile allows THREE sideloaded apps per device, total, across every project. The
//     fourth install fails with "its integrity could not be verified" and MIInstallerErrorDomain
//     error 13 — which sounds like a signing problem and is not one. The fix is to delete an app
//     (which deletes its container, and therefore its local saves) or to pay for an account.
//  3. Reinstalling does NOT reset the 7-day clock by itself. The clock starts when Apple ISSUES
//     the profile, not when you install it, and Xcode reuses a cached profile while it is still
//     valid. So an install on day 5 inherits the 2 days that remain. Moving the cached profile
//     aside makes Xcode ask Apple for a new one, and a new one is a full 7 days.
